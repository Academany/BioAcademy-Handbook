# Introduction
THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, AND NOT COMPLETE  

The role of [Bio Academy](http://www.bio.academany.org/) is to initiate and train people in the principles and practices of Synthetic biology.

It’s also a great way to gain exposure to a wide variety of synthetic biology principles and  practices and build skills in a short amount of time (typically 19 weeks). It’s not for the faint of heart (see the course requirements and 2016 schedule), but the rewards are great.

This document is written for those interested and/or participating the Bio Academy (both current and aspiring students and labs). It assumes that you already know what a Bio Lab is - and that you already have one or are in the process of setting one up.
