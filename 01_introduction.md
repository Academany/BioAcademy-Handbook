# Introduction

The role of [Fab Academy](http://www.fabacademy.org/) is to initiate, mentor and technically train new students for participation and leadership in the global Fab Lab Network community. It’s how we train our teachers.

It’s also a great way to gain exposure to a wide variety of digital fabrication, electronics, molding and casting and composites practices and build skills in a short amount of time (typically 19 weeks). It’s not for the faint of heart (see the course requirements and 2016 schedule), but the rewards are great.

This document is written for those interested and/or participating the Fab Academy (both current and aspiring students and labs). It assumes that you already know what a Fab Lab is - and that you already have one or are in the process of setting one up.
