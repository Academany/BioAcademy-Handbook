## What Are "Gurus"?

Fab Academy graduates who have shown mastery of the broad range of HTMAA and have earned the respect of their peers through their[ years of service](#bookmark=kix.eaycmcwtyl9o) to the Academy.

The role of Fab Academy Guru is to initiate, mentor and technically train new Fab Academy students for participation and leadership in the global Fab Lab Network community.

As many students are without strong local mentorship, the Guru’s key task is to monitor the students or labs placed in their charge - clearly communicating both class expectations, answering their questions, supporting them (through both email and video conferencing) and monitoring and tracking their progress and attendance.   

Gurus may be Local Instructors or they may be physically located elsewhere and function as a Remote Guru for another lab.

### Guru Responsibilities

It is the Guru’s responsibility to work with their assigned students and the local lab they mentor to verify that both equipment and supplies are available to the students in time for weekly assignments.  

While a Guru’s primary role is to keep a lab accountable and students "on task", Gurus are also cheerleaders, and at all times should provide moral support and motivation to struggling or overwhelmed students.

### On Guru-ing

Being a Fab Guru is more of an art than a science. Like each student, Gurus have very different backgrounds and each has their own style, interests and "experiential wisdom" to transmit to students.

There is no "single right way" to Guru - student’s skills, software choices and project aspirations will all be very different. A Guru’s duty is to mentor students on the Fab Academy Path, imparting wisdom that will help them successfully complete the course.

### "I Don’t Know, but I’ll Find Out" is an Acceptable Answer!

Gurus teach "How to Make Almost Anything". It’s a team effort, no one knows every facet of every area. Gurus often work as a team, using other instructors as resources.

# Distinctions Between Gurus and Local Instructors

As the network grows we have found it necessary to further distinguish between those with experience teaching Fab Academy and those who are just starting out.

## What Denotes a Guru?

A Guru is a senior instructor. Gurus have 3 or more years of Academy teaching experience, making them qualified to take on students without direct supervision.

## Who Can Be a Fab Academy Local Instructor?

The first requirement for becoming a Fab Academy Local Instructor is to complete the Fab Academy program satisfactorily.

### Year 1: Local Instructor with Mandatory Support and Supervision

* Fab Academy graduates (with the recommendation of their instructor or remote Guru) are eligible to be local Fab Academy Local Instructors.

* They must have the help of a remote Guru and / or supernode support during their first year.

### Year 2+: Stand Alone Local Instructor

* Second and third year instructors are eligible to be local Local Instructors (with the recommendation of their supernode / remote Guru) without direct remote supervision.
