# New and Aspiring Labs: Basic Requirement

## Basic Requirements for bio Academy Participation

Here are the basic requirements and expectations for any lab that wishes to participate in the the bio Academy course.

Your lab MUST be equipped with the ALL necessary digital fabrication machines, electronics components and other supplies to be able to participate in the Academy. Labs that are not properly equipped are not eligible to participate in the Academy, as the students will not be able to complete the course.

As this is a bleeding edge program, hardware and electronics specification is continually being updated. For the most up-to-date list of recommended machines and supplies, see: [the bio Lab Inventory ](http://bio.academany.org/doc/inventory)

## Local Class Working Groups

### What is the maximum / minimum number of students in a local bio Academy class?

Beyond a Local Instructor, a workgroup of students is required in order to create the necessary collaboration environment for a successful bio Academy class.

We have found that it is (nearly) impossible for a student to complete the course on their own and workgroup ensures that one student’s strong suit may help make up for another student’s weak spots and vice versa.

**Here are the general guidelines for Class Working Groups:**

* CRITICAL MASS NECESSARY: They are made up of a Local Instructor and at least 3 students or 3+ students and a Remote Guru.

* PREVENTING INSTRUCTOR OVERLOAD: Groups larger than approximately 10 students per Local Instructor or Guru are not recommended, simply because there are not enough hours in the weekly cycle for each of those students to receive appropriate guidance from a single individual.

* MACHINE LOGISTICS: In the case of multiple Local Instructors / Gurus in one lab, another 5 students can be enrolled for a recommended maximum of 15 students, as the problem now becomes a logistical one of students vs machines and machine time available (assuming standard inventory quantities).

* REMOTE LOCATION CONSOLIDATION: Likewise, it is not recommended that Guru support more than 10 remote students and every attempt should be made to group remote students in such a way that Gurus do not have students in more than 2 remote locations.
