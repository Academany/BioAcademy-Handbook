# Grading and Final Evaluation

## Evaluation Schedule

Local Instructors should be evaluating student work periodically throughout the course. A bi-weekly review is good, a weekly review with the student is ideal.

Instructors must review each student’s work according to the documentation provided by the student, NOT what was observed in the lab. Instructors should discuss incomplete work / documentation with a student on an ongoing basis. There should be no surprises at the end of the course.

In order to complete the program students need to satisfactorily complete *all *assignments and their final project.

**_Please keep in mind that these diagrams were designed last year and as so, the dates on them may not be current in some cases, yet the flow and logic remains. We will update them as soon as possible but please ignore the actual dates. _**

## Global Evaluation Committee

Members of the global evaluation committee will each spend additional 10-20 hours making the final decision on graduation.   

### **Volunteer - Help Us Out!**

Have you been an instructor in the Academy for two or more years? Will you have completed one grading cycle as an instructor by July 2016?

If so - we need you! Academy enrollment grows exponentially every year. Many hands make light work.

If you'd like to volunteer, email [globaleval at fabacademy.org](mailto:globaleval@fabacademy.org) with the **subject heading "Eval Committee Volunteer"** and note labs and years as an instructor.



## How to Contact the Committee for Re-Evaluation

I realize that there are a few of you (or your students) that were missed or slipped through the cracks during the last round.

*Any instructor who has a student that needs to be re-evaluated from a previous year should:*

1. Review the student’s work themselves first

2. If the student is complete, contact the global evaluation committee on the email address above.

3. Use the *email subject heading*** "Re-Evaluation Requested: STUDENT NAME"**

4. Then the committee will review and determine final graduation status

**Use of consistent subject headings **will help us sort and filter our huge piles of email much more easily and** enable us to more quickly address your situation. **We truly want to get last year's limbo graduation decisions resolved.

## Why Re-Evaluation Backlogs Happen

The Evaluation Committee members are **volunteering large amounts of their time** to review student work - after teaching the Academy all semester. Please keep this in mind.

# Fab Academy Evaluation Criteria

**Draft** evaluation criteria here (please check this document each week). Minor changes will be made to this document during Fab Academy, but changes to assessment requirements will only be made to future assignments, not completed assignments.
